# KW_Diffusion
-what is our deliverable? diagnostic and visualization tool.

-what is our hook? analysts should not simply use spatial weights to test for and correct problems of spatial correlation, they should be more agnostic vis-a-vis the source of the spatial correlation

-do we want to use the correlation to populate the probability matrix, or the probability that the amount of correlation is non-random? test both. 

-why do the ergm test? what else is out there? 

-write code for average community - the modal average community, or something

-what about time-varying networks?

-send johannes code for simulation.
